For this guide, you need at least one image on your computer. If you don't have one, search for the welcome-to-docker image, and select Pull.
Select Sign in on the top-right of Docker Desktop to either sign in or create a new account on Docker Hub
Before you can publish your image, you need to rename it so that Docker Hub knows that the image is yours. Run the following command to rename your image. Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your Docker ID.
docker tag docker/welcome-to-docker YOUR-USERNAME/welcome-to-docker
Go to the Images tab and find your image. In the Actions column, select the Show image actions icon and then select Push to Docker Hub.
