Persist your data between containers
If you want to persist data even after a container is deleted, you can use a volume. A volume is a location in your local filesystem, managed by Docker.
To add a volume to this project, simply go to the compose.yaml file and uncomment the following lines:

todo-database:
    # ...
    volumes:
      - database:/data/db
                      
# ...
volumes:
  database:

The volumes element that is nested in todo-database tells Compose to mount the volume named database to /data/db in the container for the todo-database service.

The top-level volumes element defines and configures a volume named database that can be used by any of the services in the Compose file.

Now, no matter how often you delete and restart the container, your data is persisted and accessible to any container on your system by mounting the database volume. 
Docker will check for a volume and create one if there is none present.
