How do i run container?

Clone the repository at https://github.com/docker/welcome-to-docker‚Å†.
git clone https://github.com/docker/welcome-to-docker
cd welcome-to-docker
Open the sample application in your IDE. Note that it already has a Dockerfile. For your own projects you need to create this yourself.

# Start your image with a node base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# The /app directory should act as the main application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the app package and package-lock.json file
COPY package*.json ./

# Copy local directories to the current local directory of our docker image (/app)
COPY ./src ./src
COPY ./public ./public

# Install node packages, install serve, build the app, and remove dependencies at the end
RUN npm install \
    && npm install -g serve \
    && npm run build \
    && rm -fr node_modules

EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app using serve command
CMD [ "serve", "-s", "build" ]

You can build an image using the following docker build command via a CLI in your project folder.

docker build -t welcome-to-docker .

Once the build is complete, an image will appear in the Images tab. Select the image name to see its details. Select Run to run it as a container. In the Optional settings remember to specify a port number (something like 8089).
